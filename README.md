### Conclusion
- Added comments in the files where necessary, explaining what each part of the code does.
- Create a `README.md` file for your documentation, including sections like Overview, Setup, File Structure, API Endpoints, etc.

This should make your codebase easier to understand and maintain. Let me know if you need help with anything else!
